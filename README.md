# Income-Calculator
- uses enums, and switch case to calculate the take home wage per hour depending on the user input of states.
- Developed a C++ income calculator that leverages enums and switch-case logic to compute state-specific after-tax hourly wages based on user input.
- Integrated user input validation, string normalization, and real-time feedback to ensure accurate state selection and wage processing.
- Utilized mathematical rounding techniques and weekly/monthly pay conversion logic to simulate a realistic payroll experience based on tax-adjusted income.
